## A Simple Markdown Previewer

- Customizable CSS for styling the preview.
- Support for Pandoc to convert Markdown to HTML.
- Simple to use command-line interface.

2. **Install Pandoc**: Ensure that you have Pandoc installed. You can download it from [the Pandoc website](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

### Usage
